# PertussisBoostNeuralNetwork
My entry to the January 16th 2024 CMI-PB (computational models of immunity - pertussis boost) prediction competition.

CMI-PB_FinalPrediction.ipynb is my official, final model code that produced my submission predictions.

CMI-PB_NN00, CMI-PB_NN01, and CMI-PB_NN02 are different versions of neural network models I experimented with before making final predictions.

Any other files contain code that I used to analyze or improve upon my models after I made my final submission for the contest.
